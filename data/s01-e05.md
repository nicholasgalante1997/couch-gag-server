## a modern hive mind

Colorado has an average of five to seven _thousand_ wildfires a year. It's been absolutely ravaged by an increasingly dry climate, coupled with sporadic periods of brief rain, and a population that really loves to smoke. When these wildfires hit, entire towns need to be relocated, highways are shut down (there are only two major highways in Colorado, the I25 that spans North to South, and the I70 which runs the full length of the state East to West, like fucking pioneer times.), and traffic and civilian life comes to all but a standstill for hours, sometimes days, as the wildfire dryrapes the land and leaves the sky a barren red and gray.

_You could do it._
