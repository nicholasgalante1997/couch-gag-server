"I don't really know if its a great idea to go dressed as a magician. They'll hold you in contempt, and you'll like, go to jail."

"Well, first of all, I am in contempt of court. That's what this will hopefully be all about. And B), its a fucking meager sum of 2,000 USD. Like this is a fucking phenomenal idea."

"I don't see a way to win doing this though."
